![Figure 1: Reviewer #2 - scary mode \[on\]](./reviewer2_custome.png)

This is the story of how a simple Shiny app became part of my costume for the Halloween TG at Scripps Oceanography.

I decided to shave my head a few days before Halloween. That same day, when my wife came home, she stared at me for a moment and said, "You look like a monk. You could go as Avatar for Halloween!" I didn't say anything, but the idea sounded pretty cool! We had a bunch of work-related events on Thursday, the 31st, but on Friday, I joined her and other friends at TG.

I pulled everything together to be The Scientist Monk, but the weather (ðŸ¥¶) didnâ€™t cooperate. So, I needed something last-minute. Then, an intrusive thought struck: grad school prepared you for last-minute solutions - itâ€™s time to Shine-y! Two minutes later, I had written an AI prompt to generate a few sentences inspired by the infamous Reviewer #2, embedded them in a super simple Shiny spinner, and headed over to TG (Fig. 1).
